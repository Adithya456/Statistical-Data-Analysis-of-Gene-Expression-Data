# Statistical-Data-Analysis-of-Gene-Expression-Data
This project aims to classify cancer types (invasive vs. non-invasive) using gene expression data and statistical analysis. Various dimensionality reduction methods and machine learning models are applied to improve the classification's predictive accuracy and to identify the most influential genes in determining cancer invasiveness.
